# NGVC

A next-generation virtual classroom focusing on making virtual learning
engaging and interactive, built for web browsers. Originally created as part of a university project, this incomplete software is as we left it when the deadline expired (with some minor changes afterward). Feel free to browse, or use the code however you see fit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies in `source/backend` and `source/frontend`
	1. `cd source/<folder>` (if you haven't already)
	2. `yarn install`
3. (Frontend only) Run the code for the first time
	1. `cd source/frontend` (if you haven't already)
	2. `yarn dev`
4. Exit (Ctrl+c) the frontend development server

Make sure both the frontend and backend are running at the same time.
